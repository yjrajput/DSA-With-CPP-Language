# DSA with C++ Language

A structured repository to help you learn and practice **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. 
This collection is ideal for both beginners and intermediate learners aiming to solidify their foundational understanding and coding skills in C++.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, each containing C++ implementations and examples:

- **basicquestions** – Common entry-level coding problems and mini-challenges.
- **basics** – C++ foundational concepts, such as syntax, data types, and I/O.
- **conditionalstatement** – Solutions and examples using `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`, and other branching logic.
- **loops** – Demonstrations of `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and nested loop constructs.
- **operators** – Use cases for arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.
- **patternprinting** – Visual patterns printed using loops (e.g., pyramids, diamonds) to enhance logic skills.

## Why This Repository Is Useful

- **Step-by-step learning path** — Progress from basics to more complex patterns and logic.
- **Hands-on practice** — Active implementation of common algorithms helps reinforce understanding.
- **C++ proficiency** — Perfect for strengthening familiarity with syntax, loops, and operator behavior in C++.

## How to Use This Repository
